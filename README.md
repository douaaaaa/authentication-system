# MERN Authentication System

This project is a full-stack authentication system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It demonstrates a complete user authentication workflow, including user registration, email verification, login, password reset, and JWT-based authentication.

## Features
- User Registration: Users can create an account by providing a unique email, a user name and password.
- Email Verification: After registration, users receive a verification email. The account must be verified to enable access. If the user didn't verify thier account the verification code will be expired
- Welcome Email: Once the email is verified, users receive a welcome email to confirm successful registration.
- Login: Registered users can log in using their credentials (their email and password).
- Password Reset: In case users forgot their password, they can request a password reset link, which is sent to their registered email address. 
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for secure authentication.
- Protected Routes: Backend routes are protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users.
- Password Hashing: User passwords are hashed using bcrypt for security.
- UI: Frontend built with React, framer motion and tailwindcss for a modern, responsive design.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, React Router, Zustand for state management, Axios for API calls, Framer motion for animation
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Nodemailer for email services, bcryptjs
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Styling: tailwindcss

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- MongoDB (local or cloud-based, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
### Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/douaaaaa/mern-authentication.git
cd mern-authentication
```
### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```
  cd server
```
2. Install dependencies:
```
  npm install
```
3. Create a .env file in the root of the backend directory with the following environment variables:
```
PORT = 8000
MONGO = your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET = your_jwt_secret
NODE_ENV = "development"
EMAIL = your_email_address
PASS = your_app_password (The 16-digit code generated by Google that is used with Nodemailer is known as an App Password. )
```
